Cricket World Cup 2023 Analysis

üéØ Project Overview

    This project provides an in-depth, team-wise analysis of the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 tournament.
    Leveraging a robust data transformation process with SQL and dynamic visualization with Power BI,
    the analysis offers key insights into team performance, batting and bowling metrics,
    boundary-hitting efficiency, and match-winning probabilities.
    
    The goal is to transform raw match data into actionable insights, providing a 
    comprehensive statistical overview of the tournament.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

    1. Data Transformation	SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)- Data cleaning, structuring, aggregations (GROUP BY, CTE), 
       conditional logic (CASE), and combining data sets (UNION ALL).
    
    2. Data Visualization & BI	Power BI Desktop- Creating interactive dashboards, 
       defining relationships (Model View), and using DAX for complex calculations (KPIs).
    
    3. Data Preparation- Power Query (M Language),Data ingestion, initial cleaning, 
       and transformation within Power BI.

‚ú® Key Analysis & Visualizations
     The Power BI dashboard features a variety of key performance indicators and team-wise comparisons, as showcased in the project image:

Summary KPIs
  
    1. Total Runs Scored (24K)
    2. Total Matches Played (94)
    3. Average Runs per Match (503.08)
    4. Boundary Count (2885)
    5. Boundary Confidence (53.1%)

Team Performance Metrics

    1. First Winnings Winning Percentage: Probability of winning a match after batting first.
    2. Man of the Match by Team: Count of individual Man of the Match awards for each team.
    3. Run Rate by Team: Comparison of the average run rate for all teams.

Batting & Bowling Metrics

    1. 4s and 6s by Team: Sum of boundaries hit, highlighting powerful batting sides.
    2. Wickets by Team: Total number of wickets taken by each team's bowlers.
    3. Scores by Team: Total runs scored by each team throughout the tournament.

üí° Key Insights from the Data

The analysis highlights significant performance trends and differences between the participating teams:

1. Dominance of Winning Teams
   
    a. Australia and India show superior consistency, with winning percentages in the first innings at 90.91% and 81.82%, respectively.
       This suggests these teams are extremely successful at setting or defending a total.

    b. Unsurprisingly, Australia and India also lead the charts for Total Scores and Man of the Match awards,
       indicating their players delivered the most impactful individual and team performances.

3. Boundary Reliance vs. Rotation
   
    a. Australia and India are clearly the most prolific boundary hitters, leading in the combined Sum
       of 4s and 6s with 66 and 60, respectively.

    b. However, when looking at Runrate by Team, India (6.4) and New Zealand (6.2) demonstrate the highest 
       scoring speed, suggesting an effective blend of boundary-hitting and quick running between the wickets.

5. Bowling Performance
   
    a. Australia and England are the most effective bowling sides, having taken the most wickets (88 each). This suggests
       they possess the most penetrative bowling attacks, despite England's low overall tournament performance.

    b. In contrast, teams like Afghanistan and India have taken fewer wickets (63 and 58, respectively) but still
       performed well overall, suggesting they rely more on restricting runs (implied by their high run rates) 
       rather than aggressively bowling teams out.

7. Middle-Tier Consistency
   
    a. South Africa consistently appears in the top-to-middle tier across most categories (Wickets, Runrate, 4s/6s),
       validating their reputation as a strong but perhaps less dominant side compared to the top two.
       Their lower 50.00% first innings win rate compared to Australia and India is a notable drop-off.
